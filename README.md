# Google Stock Price Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs analysis on Google's stock prices. The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualization, and predictive modeling.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze historical stock prices of Google (GOOGL) and build a predictive model that can forecast future prices. The project covers the following:

- Data collection and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Building and evaluating machine learning models
- Visualization of stock price trends and model predictions

## Contents

- **Google stock price.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis and modeling.
- **data/**: A folder that should contain the stock price data in CSV format.
- **models/**: A folder to save trained models.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Dependencies

To run the notebook, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow (if using deep learning models)
- yfinance (for downloading stock data)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow yfinance
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Navini11/google-stock-price-analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd google-stock-price-analysis
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook "Google stock price.ipynb"
```

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to perform the analysis.

## Results

The notebook includes the following key results:

- Descriptive statistics and visualizations of Google's historical stock prices.
- Machine learning models trained to predict stock prices.
- Evaluation metrics for model performance.

## Future Work

Potential improvements and future directions for this project include:

- Incorporating more features like technical indicators, market sentiment, or macroeconomic factors.
- Experimenting with more advanced machine learning models or deep learning architectures.
- Enhancing the predictive power of the models by tuning hyperparameters and using ensemble techniques.
